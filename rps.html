                        <p class="card-tex mb-auto fs-5" id="para-txt">Ritik Pratap Singh follows an unpredictable
                            route,
                            scarcely
                            interjected by insights into anything other than India's politics. Coming from a

                            upon
                            what the politician offer. In an attempt to valourize almost every breath he has ever
                            taken,
                            Ritik Pratap Singh is in the good books of many prominent and powerful political
                            leaders,
                            cabinet ministers, National leaders all because of his good work for this nation.
                            Carrying
                            out charity selflessly is one of the deeds that Ritik Pratap Singh has been implementing
                            from
                            his heart, without expecting a reward. He also aims to raise funds for foundations that

                            youth.
                            Some of the more interesting revelations about him are that apart from being a
                            politician

                            inspire
                            others in such deeds. It is due to his, this act of nature that makes him precious and
                            soulful
                            that manages to draw moments of earthiness.</p>
